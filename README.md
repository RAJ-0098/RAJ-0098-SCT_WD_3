**Tic Tac Toe Web App**  
A responsive, interactive Tic Tac Toe game built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Features two gameplay modes: Player vs Player and Player vs Computer (with intelligent AI moves). The clean UI includes a game board with perfect grid alignment, winning move animations, and real-time turn indicators.

Key technical aspects:
- **Game Logic**: Pure JavaScript handles win conditions, draws, and player switching
- **AI System**: Computer makes strategic moves using a priority algorithm (win > block > center > random)
- **Statistics**: Tracks wins/losses/draws separately for all players
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid ensures perfect square cells on all devices
- **Modern UI**: Animated winning combos and smooth transitions

The project demonstrates core web development skills including DOM manipulation, event handling, and state management without frameworks. Ideal for beginners to study game logic implementation or as a portfolio piece showcasing clean frontend code.

**How to Play**:  
1. Select game mode  
2. Click cells to place X/O  
3. First to 3 in a row wins!  
4. Reset or view stats anytime
